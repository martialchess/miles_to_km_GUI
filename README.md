# Mile to Kilometer Converter (Tkinter GUI)

A beginner-friendly Python GUI application that converts miles into kilometers using **Tkinter**.  

This project demonstrates:
- Creating a GUI window with Tkinter.
- Using **Labels**, **Entry**, and **Button** widgets.
- Laying out widgets with the `.grid()` geometry manager.
- Handling user input with `.get()` and updating labels dynamically.
- Basic unit conversion logic (miles → kilometers).
